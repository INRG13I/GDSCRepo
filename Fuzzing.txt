Fuzzing

What is considered as a good output:
-good format
-good memory access
-same output if you run the program 2or more times
-


Generating GOOD random inputs:
-random bytes to a file(problem if you have structures like the ones for html)
-inputs according to a formal grammar(in case of string ez in case of structures think bout graphs and trees)
-use known correct inputs and modify them
